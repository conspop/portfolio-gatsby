[Deployed App](https://sebbeitel.dev)

## Description

My personal developer portfolio site.

## Technologies Used

- Gatsby
- React JS
- HTML/CSS/Javascript

## Next Steps

- The most important next step is to complete the app by adding the Create Invoice functionality. The user will provide a studio and a timeframe and the app will generate a downloadable invoice for them.
- Give the user more flexibility for adding classes. For example, I will add the ability to choose different frequencies for classes other than weekly. I will also add more types of payment terms like minimums.
- Provide users with notifications. They could select to have a daily schedule sent to their email or be notified when they have classes that have not been tagged.
- I would like to add a tutorial to the app so it is easier for new users to understand.
